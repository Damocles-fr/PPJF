# Jellyfin with PotPlayer – Setup Guide  ## SRY for my english, translation done with AI

This tutorial explains how to set up Jellyfin Server on Windows to:

    Launch medias from the Jellyfin web interface directly in PotPlayer.

    Enable access to the corresponding media folder in Windows File Explorer from the Jellyfin media information panel.

    Start and stop the Jellyfin server automatically while launching the browser web interface and closing it.
	
	Bonus : Select text and one click search selection on IMDB, YOUTUBE, or any websites

---

Please use Notepad++
Jellyfin Server is installed as a service.
All applications (Jellyfin, PotPlayer, LibreWolf) are installed in their **default paths** on drive C.
Not tested with Chrome – using LibreWolf is recommended for this setup.
I strongly recommend to install LibreWolf separately from your main browser.
You can install Firefox/LibreWolf/Nightly/Any fork on the same computer.
This allows to start the Jellyfin server automatically while launching the web interface and to stop jellyfin server after closing it.
Also this way you launch Jellyfin directly in full-screen mode and/or hide the browser menu bar, as well as enabling separate configurations such as a default zoom of 120%, differents firefox addons for this browser etc...

## Security Notice

- For local folder link, you need to install "LienExplorerFirefoxnative-app-setup.exe" and the firefox extension "Local Filesystem Links" by austrALIENsun, AWolf
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/feinstaub/webextension_local_filesystem_links)
- If you have security concerns, feel free not to install it.
- I have no affiliation with this extension or its creators.
- Use a separate LibreWolf/Firefox installation to minimize risks.

## Installation Steps
It's much better to use Notepad++ to view this and the scripts to edits.
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

### 0. Download PPJF.zip

Download https://github.com/Damocles-fr/PPJF/blob/main/PPJF.zip

### 1. Install Jellyfin Server

- Choose **“Install as a Service”** during the installation process
- Default path

If it don't work with your already saved Jellyfin settings, you can reset some settings by deleting files in C:\ProgramData\Jellyfin\Server\config like network.xml and maybe other files too idk.
/!\ This will reset your server settings /!\

### 2. Install LibreWolf (a lighter and Privacy optimised Firefox)

- Install **LibreWolf** (or any fork that supporting **ViolentMonkey/TamperMonkey** extension).
https://librewolf.net/installation/windows/
- Default path: `C:\Program Files\LibreWolf`

### 3. Install PotPlayer

- No need to reinstall if already installed
- Default path: `C:\Program Files\DAUM\PotPlayer`

### 4. Place Required Files

- Move the PotPlayerJellyfin folder to :
  ```
  C:\ProgramData\
  ```
If you put it anywhere else, adapt any lines with your own path.

so you should have C:\ProgramData\PotPlayerJellyfin\
With nine files in it.

### 5. Edit `potplayer.ps1`

- Open potplayer.ps1 with **Notepad++** or Edit/Modify

Here, the weird "^D\\" "\\" and ":\\?" are completely normal phenomenon, please don't ask me why, and just don't touch it if it works.

Replace all and ONLY the letter `D` and `T` with your Jellyfin media library drive letters.
Then, in the second part, replace ONLY the path after ":\\?" and ":\" with your jellyfin library FIRST ROOT folder corresponding to the paths.
Add as many lines as drives and root folder you use with jellyfin.
Here for exemple with four media library in Jellyfin located in "D:\folder\folder2\yourlibrary" and "D:\folder\anotherlibrary" and "D:\differentlibraries\..." and "T:\Media" :

  ```# Corriger les chemins de base (uniquement au début de la chaîne)
$path = $path -replace "^D\\", "D:\"
$path = $path -replace "^T\\", "T:\"
$path = $path -replace "^D/", "D:\"
$path = $path -replace "^T/", "T:\"

# Assurer les chemins spécifiques
$path = $path -replace "D:\\?folder\", "D:\folder\"
$path = $path -replace "D:\\?differentlibraries\", "D:\differentlibraries\"
$path = $path -replace "T:\\?Media", "T:\Media"
  ```
  
- If you use a different Potplayer installation path, modify the last line that is set to PotPlayer defaut installation folder C:\Program Files\DAUM\PotPlayer\PotPlayerMini64.exe

### 6. If don't use default settings for Jellyfin network and Librewolf, edit `Jellyfin.bat` `OpenMediaInfoPathScriptmonkey.js` & `OpenWithPotplayerUserscript.js`

- Those files are set to LibreWolf default path and Jellyfin Server default URL :
http://localhost:8096 and librewolf.exe path C:\Program Files\LibreWolf\librewolf.exe"
- If you use those settings, default settings, skip to 7.
- If not, edit the files.
- In Jellyfin.bat modify it for your **LibreWolf/Firefox path**, **process name** (Firefox.exe or LibreWolf.exe), and **Jellyfin URL**:
  ```
  curl -s http://localhost:8096 > nul
	if %errorlevel% neq 0 (ping -n 1 -w 100 127.0.0.1 > nul & goto waitForServer)
	start "" "C:\Program Files\LibreWolf\librewolf.exe" -url "http://localhost:8096/web/index.html#/home.html"


	tasklist | find /i "librewolf.exe" >nul
  ```

- If your Jellyfin Server is not set the default adress "http://localhost:8096/"
	Edit the two `.js` scripts to replace "http://localhost:8096/ with your Jellyfin web URL :
  ```
  javascript
  // @match        http://localhost:8096/web/index.html


  ```
Jellyfin.bat detects when there is no more "LibreWolf.exe" process running, then it stop Jellyfin server service process.

## IMPORTANT ##

- If you close the .bat (black window) before closing the browser, the Jellyfin Server will keep running in the background.
- Sometimes if it stop working, because of idk wtf, **PotPlayer updates** or some specific settings change, just **re-run** `PotPlayerMini64.reg`.
Should be fine but if it happens too often, you can add a line in the .bat to run PotPlayerMini64.reg everytime.
